# Database-Management-Systems-Project

---

The database we create is meant to house the information for all users inside of an app. The app is called Logical Limit and is designed to limit screen time usage for children. Parents can sign themselves and their children up for the app. The parents control certain parameters/restrictions allowed for the child, dependent on preference.

The database consists of 8 tables: Child, Device, Emergency Signal, Location, Parent, Subscription, Task, Usage_Report.

This is a relational database so tables share relationships that link them to one another.
